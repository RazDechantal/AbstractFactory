Abstract Factory in C++
Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern, which solves the problem of creating entire product families without specifying their concrete classes.

Abstract Factory defines an interface for creating all distinct products but leaves the actual product creation to concrete factory classes. Each factory type corresponds to a certain product variety.
Builder in C++
Builder is a creational design pattern, which allows constructing complex objects step by step.

Unlike other creational patterns, Builder doesnâ€™t require products to have a common interface. That makes it possible to produce different products using the same construction process
